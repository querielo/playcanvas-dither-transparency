# Description

Playcanvas Project: https://playcanvas.com/project/1051789/overview/dither-transparency

The repo contains the next Typescript ScriptComponent for Playcanvas:

*ditherTransparency* --- it implements the dithering transparency technique requested in the next issue: https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/issues/5159.

Probably, I think it works on Playcanvas +1.55.0.

The repo is based on the [Playcanvas TypeScript Template](https://github.com/querielo/playcanvas-typescript-template). I highly recommend you to check it out. Read more about usage of Playcanvas Overdraw in the Playcanvas TypeScript Template.
